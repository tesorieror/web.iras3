				<div class="tile-title tile-big-x tile-half-y">Purpose</div>
				<div class="tile tile-big-x tile-big-y bg-darkBlue" style="padding: 15px; text-align: justify;">
					<p>The main task of the unit is to provide management and operational support by carrying out evaluations in relation to the King Abdulaziz
						University's goals and policies and by monitoring and analyzing the University's external environment. The purpose of this work is to lay the groundwork
						for the University Management's strategic decision making regarding the Academic standards systems and Higher Education Excellency.</p>
					<p>The unit complements the planning and follow-up efforts carried out around the University, for higher education excellence, by providing in-depth
						analysis, thus contributing significantly to this quite resource-demanding type of work. We perform evaluations both at the request of the University's
						management and when we determine there is a need to predict and obtain the possible results of the current most important evaluation systems, to draw the
						actions KAU has to perform before the start of each year.</p>

				<div class="tile-title tile-big-x tile-half-y">Ambition</div>
				<div class="tile tile-big-x tile-big-y bg-darkBlue" style="padding: 15px; text-align: justify;">
					<p>Work in close collaboration with KAU Faculties and Departments, by offering opportunities to interchange the academic and research data to use it in
						the planning of an evaluation process. We will inform faculties about their progress in the research areas (number of publications, citations,
						international collaboration publishing papers, etc.)</p>
					<p>Make our evaluation results meaningful and prevent evaluation fatigue by ensuring clear and action-oriented feedback of our findings. KAU will have
						updated data of its progress during the year, which will help us to lay our efforts in the correct place, and to draw action plans for it.</p>
					<p>Control of Highly Cited people and study their improvement, each semester. And have the possibility to predict the list before being publish by
						HighlyCited.com.</p>
